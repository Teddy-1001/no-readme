command line interface is one the many ways users can interact with a computer system.
what we mostly use is GUI (Graphical User Interface). It depicts user interactions as graphics (folder, files, icons) rather than text commands.
we have other types of intefaces{
    CLI (Command Line Interface): This is a text-based interface where users interact with the computer by typing commands into a console or terminal.
    TUI (Text User Interface): This is a user interface that uses text and symbols to represent the interface, often in a more structured way than a CLI.
    GUI (Graphical User Interface): This is a visual interface that allows users to interact with the computer using graphical elements like windows, icons, and buttons.
    visual interfaces: These are interfaces that use visual elements to represent the system, often combining text and graphics.
}
CLI>>>>>This is an interface that mostly deal with memorizing commands to interact with computers at a lower level through a terminal.
it is one of the essensials skills for developers and system administrators.
advantages{
    - Speed: CLI allows for faster navigation and execution of commands compared to GUI.
    safety
    allows remote access and file sharing through   IP adress
}
examples of terminals used to interact with the computer{
    - Command Prompt (Windows)
    - Terminal (macOS),(Linux)
    - GNOME Terminal (Linux)
    - PowerShell (Windows)  
    - Bash/gitbash (Linux, macOS)
}

using command line interface, always remember the path that you are using
types of path{
    - Absolute Path: This is the complete path to a file or directory from the root of the file system. It always starts with a root directory (e.g., / for Linux/macOS, C:\ for Windows).
    - Relative Path: This is a path that is relative to the current working directory. It does not start with a root directory and is often shorter than an absolute path.

commands used{
    pwd>>>>>>>>print working directory. This prints the currents folder the user is in
    ls>>>>>>>>list files and directories in the current directory{
        ls -l>>>>>>>>prints the files inclusive of the time stampt
        ls -a>>>>>>>>prints hidden files and contents
    }
    {
        cd>>>>>>>>change directory. This command is used to navigate between directories.{ from documents to downloads}{
            cd ..>>>>>>>>go back to the previous directory
            cd .>>>>>>>>stay in the current directory
        }
        mkdir>>>>>>>>make directory. This command is used to create a new directory in an absolute or relative Path
        rmdir>>>>>>>>remove directory. This command is used to delete an empty directory.Only when you are outside the directory you want to delete.
        rm>>>>>>>>remove file. This command is used to delete a file or directory. Be careful with this command, as it does not move files to the trash.
                rm -r>>>>>>>>remove directory and its contents recursively
                rm -f>>>>>>>>force remove a file or directory without prompting for confirmation
                

        touch>>>>>>>>create a new empty file. This command is used to create a new file in the current directory.
        {
            [command] [filename]
            touch index.html
        }
    }
